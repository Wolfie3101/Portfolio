Portfolio

I'm Aleksander from Slovenia, and I decided to put my portfolio on github for job hunting.
I'm currently working on the udemy's course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The TinDog and the drum kit are from the course which show knowledge from Bootstrap and JS.
The rock paper scissors game I made for fun to show off JS.
More projects are going to be uploaded.
